Description: 
        # Apple Health Data Exporter
        
        This Python 3 script takes a dump of Apple Health data (the `export.zip` file
        generated through an Apple Health data export) and saves a subset of fields and
        records to a [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) file. This can then be
        read by both Python and R.
